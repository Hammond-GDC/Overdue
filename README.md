# Overdue
Enter the Dangerous Chronology of Lucy and Mary.

Mary is a time manipulator.
She has the power to reverse time without limit and consequence, and uses this power to appear a perfect being. she fails a test? food spills on her clothes? stutters in her sentences? run that back :rewind: 

Lucy is a stubborn realist.
Somehow, when near Mary, she is aware of each time reversal, and is also aware of how irritable and mentally unstable Mary is from maintaining this image. But it's not like she gives a damn... at least until Mary confesses her love to Lucy, and you can imagine how much trial and error that would take.

Eventually Lucy just snaps at Mary for doing this to her and everyone else, basically being a manipulative asshole and such without anyone knowing, inherently revealing that they know and remember everything.
But Mary doesn't give up. In fact she pulls a galaxy brain move and sends Lucy back to the beginning of the school year, saying she'll only let Lucy progress her life if they accept their confession.

Now, Lucy *could* just submit to Mary... or she could embark on an elaborate temporal mystery and find out how to escape the loop peacefully.

You have a full 180 days of freedom to uncover a way to escape the loop. Talk to others and reveal more info regarding the events of the school year. Solve problems that would be seldom possible without going through another loop. You can skip any amount of time and let everything progess as normal then if you wish. However, you must refuse Mary's ultimatum yourself to reset the loop.

Lucy automatically records events if something different happens as a result of her actions. Use her planner to track key events, progress questlines, and pave your way to break the loop.

There are multiple endings to encounter... in all of them, you escape the loop. Choose your actions carefully and think outside the box.
